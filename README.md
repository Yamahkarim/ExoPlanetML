# Exoplanet Explorations 
### Exoplanet Classification with Machine Learning 

![space](img/space.jpg) 


## Objective 

<b> Is it a planet? </b>  

This project seeks to answer this question from 9 years worth of data collected by Nasa's Keppler Space Telescope. 

I deploy machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

This project walks through the full life cycle of machine learning which include: Data Preprocessing, Model Tuning, and comparing 3 ML models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines.  

## Technologies 

Python 3 
	
	- Pandas 
	- Matplotlib 
	- Numpy 
	- Scikit Learn 
	- Keras + Tensorflow 
	- Jupyter Notebook

## Explore 
1.) Create and initialize a new [virtual enviornment](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/) 

2.) Download the required dependencies and technologies listed above. 

3.) Clone the repo. Navigate to the downloaded repo with a CLI. 

4.) Deploy a jupyter notebook within the downloaded repo directory by running `jupyter notebook` command  

5.) The Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors are located within the `LogisticKNearest.ipnyb` notebook. 

6.) The Support Vector Machine model can be explored within the file `SupportVectorMachines.ipynb`
